Multi-view SAR image registration based on feature extraction 
In this program I have used one python file which consists of Multi-view SAR image registration based on feature extraction code.
I also used two images, first image is reference imgae and the second image is sensed image and I added the path in the program.
To run the code:-
  Open the terminal or any ide then change directry to CVPR file.
  The code and the input images are in the CVPR file.
  Run the python code by (python3 CVPR.py) finally,
  It will display output of the Registered sar image.
We can test the samples by changing the image1.jpeg and image2.jpeg path with the sample images and run the pyhton code it will display the output as Registered sar image.
